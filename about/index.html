     <h1 style="font-size:30px;">About me</h1>
     <p>I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/gssi.it/csgssi/home?authuser=0">Computer Science Department</a> of <a href="https://www.gssi.it">Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI)</a> in L'Aquila, Italy. Currently, I'm working on the topic of <em>Adaptive Influence Maximization</em> under the supervision of <a href="https://cs.gssi.it/gianlorenzo.dangelo/index.html">Gianlorenzo D'Angelo</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cosimo-vinci">Cosimo Vinci</a>.</p>
     <h2 style="font-size:30px;">About my research</h2>
     <p> The <em>influence maximization (IM)</em> problem is a well known NP-hard problem of selecting the <em>k </em>most influential nodes in a network. Kempe et al. in their seminal work, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/kdd03-inf.pdf">"Maximizing the Spread of Influence through a Social Network"</a>, formulized the IM problem as a discrete optimization problem. We call this the vanilla/non-adaptive IM problem, which will serve as the base for the adaptive version, which was studied by Golovin and Krause extensively in their <a href="https://www.aaai.org/Papers/JAIR/Vol42/JAIR4212.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
