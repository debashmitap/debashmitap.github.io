     <p>I was a PhD student at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/gssi.it/csgssi/home?authuser=0">Computer Science Department</a> of <a href="https://www.gssi.it">Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI)</a> in L'Aquila, Italy. My thesis topic was on <em>Adaptive Influence Maximization</em> under the supervision of <a href="https://cs.gssi.it/gianlorenzo.dangelo/index.html">Gianlorenzo D'Angelo</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cosimo-vinci">Cosimo Vinci</a>.</p>
     <p> I was also a <a href="https://www.unive.it/data/people/27074279/curriculum">Postdoctoral Researcher</a> at the <a href =" https://www.unive.it/pag/16129">Department of Environmental Sciences, Informatics and Statistics</a> of <a href="https://www.unive.it/pag/13526">Ca' Foscari University of Venice</a>. I was working on the <a href="https://www.eumeplat.eu"> EUMEPLAT </a> project with <a href="https://www.unive.it/data/persone/14075308/curriculum"> Fabiana Zollo</a>.</p> 
     <p> I did my second postdoc at <a href="hhttps://www.cmcc.it/">CMCC</a> in the <a href="https://www.cmcc.it/what-we-do/institutes/institute-for-climate-resilience-icr/risk-assessment-and-adaptation-strategies">RAAS</a> division where I used ML methods to deal with risk hazards in the coastal regions of Italy and Spain. I also supervised a Master's thesis as part of my work, where the challenge was to build a chatbot using a pre-pretrained LLM for the dissemination of information to the stakeholders.</p> 
     <p> My current work at the <a href="https://www.cmcc.it/">Free University of Bozen-Bolzano</a> involves building an AI-lab from scratch and using different company data fr training and providing them with solutions. I am working under Prof. <a href="https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/engineering/academic-staff/person/3562-diego-calvanese">Diego Calvanese</a>.
     <p> I am passionate about data, food and travel. I love working with numbers, and occasionally take a break by researching about food. Sometimes, I contribute to <a href="https://rnd.today">RnD</a> which is a blog about eating and traveling in Europe.</p>

     <h2 style="font-size:30px;">About my research</h2>
     <p> The <em>influence maximization (IM)</em> problem is a well known NP-hard problem of selecting the <em>k </em>most influential nodes in a network. Kempe et al. in their <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/kdd03-inf.pdf">seminal work</a>, formulized the IM problem as a discrete optimization problem. We call this the vanilla/non-adaptive IM problem, which will serve as the base for the adaptive version, studied by Golovin and Krause extensively in their <a href="https://www.aaai.org/Papers/JAIR/Vol42/JAIR4212.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
     <p> The results for the IM problem is obtained by resorting to a greedy algorithm, which gives us a constant upper bound of <em>1-(1/e)</em> following the results of <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~eidan/papers/submod-max.pdf">Nemhauser et al.</a>
