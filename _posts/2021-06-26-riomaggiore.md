My 38 days of long vacation started today. I have always wanted to visit *Cinque Terre* (which means 5 lamds in Italian) since the time I arrived in Italy. It's composed of 5 villages along the famous Italian Riviera: *Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore*. These 5 villages form the *CParco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre*, and is concidered to be a *UNESCO World Heritage Site*.
