Today was a super busy day. In the morning, I had a meeting with one of my supervisors, Cosimo. We are working on a paper, so we try to meet every Wednesday. The meeting concluded with us agreeing that there were a lot of proofs needed to be written clearly. When we write mathematical proofs, sometimes we forget that a lot of specifications that is known to us, might not be known to the reader. The proofs might make no sense if it's not written and explained clearly. A lot of mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists forget the need to write comprehensible proofs so that a reader can actually be interested in their work. Moral: write clear proofs and code.

I spent my afternoon doing a challenge that required me to bake a pie with a blindfold on. I will be guided by my partner, who can speak only three times during the whole challenge, and he needs to guide me with his hands. The challenge is from a book we purchased, and it's called <a href="https://www.theadventurechallenge.com">The Adventure Challenge</a>. The book consists of 50 unknown challenges, and every time we are in a mood for something new, we can scratch off one challenge. The best part is, they specify the time and the amount of money we need to spend for a specific challenge in the description. So we can scratch a page which suits our time and budget. Our first challenge was to bake a pie (sweet or savoury) and the better baker needs to blindfold the other one (me) who will be baking the pie. We decided on a chicken pie. For safety reasons, we chopped and cooked the chicken filling before starting off the challenge. 

The challenge begun with my partner, Renan, blindfolding me. We started to make the pie crust from scratch. He placed my hands on the ingredients and tapped my hands when I poured enough of it. After mixing all the ingredients, I had to knead the dough for 5 minutes, and then came the rolling part, which was the hardest one. I had to rely completely on my sense of touch to roll out the dough as evenly as possible. Since Renan could speak 3 times, he would use it just to let me know if I was rolling the right corner. He would occasionally turn the dough so that I can roll out the uneven parts. I had to roll out two separate doughs for the top and bottom. We coated the aluminium tray with some oil, placed the rolled out dough on the bottom, filled in with the cooked chicken, and used the other dough to cover it. Then we brushed the top with some egg wash and Renan scored the dough with a knife. After that we put it inside the oven for half an hour at 200&deg;C.

The final product was quite pleasant, however, the top crust was a bit too thick and doughy. I was quite surprised how well it turned out, so I'll share the recipe here so that people can try it with or without a blindfold.

Ingredients

1. 300g all purpose flour
2. 1 tbsp hard butter
3. 1 tbsp vegetable oil
4. pinch of salt
5. 1 cup chicken broth
6. 300g shredded chicken breast
7. 2 cloves of chopped garlic
8. 1 diced carrot (You can use any vegetable of your choice)
9. Any seasoning of your choice (I used basil, oregano, paprika, black pepper, rosmary, salt, red pepper flakes)
10. 50g of ricotta
11. Half a beaten egg

Instructions

1. Boil the chicken breast and store the broth to use it in the dough later. Shred the chicken once its cooked.
2. In a pot, heat up some oil and throw in the chopped garlic and carrots, and cook it for a minute of two in medium flame.
3. Put the shredded chicken and the seasonings in the pot and mix it well. If it gets too dry, use a tbsp or two of the chicken broth. 
4. Turn off the heat and mix in the ricotta.
5. For the dough, combine the flour and hard butter together and once incorporated properly, add the oil, salt and chicken broth. 
6. Make two separate doughs for the top and bottom layers, and the roll out the two doughs until it reaches an 1-1mm thickness.
7. Brush some oil or butter in the baking tray and put the rolled in dough and line the sides. Fill in with the chicken filling and put the second dough on top
8. Brush the egg on top and score the pie with a knife.
9. Put the tray in a preheated oven for half an hour at a temperature of 200&deg;C.
