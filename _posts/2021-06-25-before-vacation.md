Today was the last working day before I take a vacation. Well, I spent my entire morning cleaning the house. After lunch, I decided to finish watching the last episode of *Somebody Feed Phil*. The show is about a guy named Phil, who travels across the globe in search of good food and culture. Since I am a sucker for food and culture, this show appeals to me a lot. It's a *Netflix* original, and has been renewed for the 5th season. 


Later, I decided to meet with my Italian friend Ilaria (I talked about her a bit in the last post). She is 6 months pregnant, and will be blessed with a boy this October. The last time I met her was in March, when she mentioned to me that she was pregnant. It was an accidental pregnancy, but she decided to keep the baby, and become a young mother. Her boyfriend, Vincenzo (I call him Vincent) is an extremely hardworking guy. Ilaria was studying for the Sommelier certification course. She always dreamt of having her own restaurant and this course is a step forward in achieving her goal. Today, she seemed quite anxious about her future with the baby. She is 21, and she wants to be a working mom. We spent some time walking and talking about what she wants to do after the baby arrives. I also met her parents, who came to pick her up, and they looked lovely as always.

After this meeting, I had an *aperitivo* with my classmates from the Italian lesson. An aperitivo is an Italian tradition of going out for some drinks and snacks after work. It's during the evening, right before dinner. As the name suggests, it literally whets our appetite. It was quite nice to see everyone together physically and not via zoom calls. Somehow, the idea of talking to people over a telematic device never appeased me. It's convinient when the person is based in a different location, but the conversations never feel the same. We discussed about food, politics and culture. Since we come from different countries and backgrounds, it's always facinating to hear stories from such diverse community.
