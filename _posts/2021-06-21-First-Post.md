Hi! From the 21st of June 2021, I'll post a write up about my daily life for 500 days, which is approximately the time when I'll be defending my PhD thesis. 
This blog will be my online day to day journal, where I'll talk about the highlights of my day. As a result, I'll have approximately 500 posts.
