Today is *summer solstice* (or *midsummer* if you're a Brit) in the Northern Hemisphere! The sunset occured around 20:46 in L'Aquila, Italy, the place where I live. 
I decided to take the longest day of the year kinda slow. I stayed at home, worked a bit, did laundry, and indulged myself into some daydreaming. Nothing exciting. My lunch was a bowl of *Murgh Makhani* (famously know as *butter chicken*), which was frozen and thawed by the microwave. I think, the most interesting part of the day was making the coffee. I bought a can of *illycaffè* from Trieste last year, which was founded by the Illy family in Trieste. The coffee was from Guatemala and has strong notes of chocolate. 

I used my *moka* pot to brew some coffee. Now, a moka pot is an indispensable item in every Italian household. Some even have more than one, just in case. The most common one is from the Bialetti brand named after the founder of moka pot, Alfonso Bialetti. I have the traditional stove top moka. There is science involved in how the moka pot works. The moka has three sections: the bottom section where we pour in the water, the middle section which holds the coffee and has a funnel submerged in the bottom part, and the upper section, which has a funnel through which the brewed coffee comes out. All these chambers are tightly locked to build up pressure inside the moka. Once the water starts boiling, the steam built up inside the bottom section forces the water to go through the funnel, mix with the coffee and finally come out through the upper section. Pretty simple physics, right?

I like to take my coffee with milk. Since, I don't use sugar or any kind of sweetners, it becomes difficult for me to drink black coffee. I like frothing the milk with a battery operated frother, and pour the freshly brewed coffee from the moka pot into a mug. It was not as good as the Cafés, but I wanted to be in my PJs for the whole day. Later in the evening, I worked a bit more, and planned for the next few days before my trip, which is in four days.
