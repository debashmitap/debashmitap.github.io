Today was somewhat eventful for me. I decided to work from the open space (that's what we call our office in our institute). We don't have separate rooms for the PhD students, but a single large hall for all the students of a specific year. So we generally sit together with the physicicts, computer scientists, mathematicians and social scientists, each of us with a separate desk, cabinet and chair. In the afternoon, I tried the new *Ferrero Rocher* ice cream, which was just okay compared to the delicious Italian gelato. Pietro Ferrero was an Italian confectioner, who invented *Nutella*, and used the same ingredients to make the famous Ferrero Rocher balls. Apparently, he used hazelnuts to reduce the cost of buying chocolate. Anyway, coming back to their newly launched ice creams, I decided to stick to the classic one. The ice cream had a hazelnut gelato, which honestly tasted like water, and was coated with milk chocolate and chopped hazelnuts. The coating was really sweet for my taste, but probably because the coating was supposed to be the only thing to give a taste to the otherwise bland ice cream.

My evening was dedicated to Skype calls with my university friends. Two of my classmates whom I haven't met in almost three and four years respectively, are doing their PhDs in Hungary. Théo (one of my best friends from university) and I meet or Skype each other on a regular basis. He is situated in France, and lives an hour long drive from Paris. We decided to meet these two guys back in 2020. However, the pandemic happened, and our plans were ruined. With everyone getting vaccinated, we decided to finally carry out our reunion. We had a Skype call with them this evening, and finalized our meeting in the middle of August this year. Théo and I will be travelling to Budapest and take a nice long trip in Hungary with our friends. *A reunion trip!* 

As I started writing my blog, I got an email from the Italian health ministry stating that my *EU Digital COVID certificate* is ready to be downloaded. The certificate is basically a QR code, which contains information about my vaccination, and allows me to move freely in the EU. I'm quite relieved since I'll be travelling outside Italy next week, and this certificate will be my green pass.
