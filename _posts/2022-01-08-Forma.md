Italians are traditionalist when it comes to their cuisine. It is considered to be a crime to use *pancetta* (cured pork belly) instead of *guanciale* (cured pork cheek)
in *Carbonara*. If you can't get hold of guanciale, either fly to Italy and order a plate of authentic Carbonara, or just stick to your normal *Mac and Cheese*.

L'Aquila is a small historic city in Italy. It is the capital of the Abruzzo region, and came to recognition after the devastating earthquake in 2009, 
with a death toll of 308 people, 1173 injured, and thousands being homeless.
Førma calls itself a contenporary restaurant in L'aquila. They combine the flavours of Italy with Asia. Imagine a tiramisu with layers of *Nori* instead of the traditional *Savoiardi*.
As a note, L'aquila's restaurant scenario is limited to just traditional *tratorrias* and a few sushi places which the Italians are obsessed with(more on that in another post).
Fusion restaurant in a small city like L'Aquila, sounds pretty hard to sell. 
However, with their monthly menu changes and the use of seasonal products, FØRMA's head chef, Simone Ciuffetelli is a reformer. Simone and his wife, Roberta lived in Denmark for two years,
and works towards bringing their experiences and culture on a plate. As you might have guessed, the letter ø, comes from the Danish language.
