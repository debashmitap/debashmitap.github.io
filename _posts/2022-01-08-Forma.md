Italians are traditionalist when it comes to their cuisine. It is considered to be a crime to use *pancetta* (cured pork belly) instead of *guanciale* (cured pork cheek)
in *Carbonara*. If you can't get hold of guanciale, either fly to Italy and order a plate of authentic Carbonara, or just stick to your normal *Mac and Cheese*.

L'Aquila is a small historic city in Italy. It is the capital of the Abruzzo region, and came to recognition after the devastating earthquake in 2009, with a death toll of 308 people, 1173 injured, and thousands being homeless. 

Førma calls itself a contemporary restaurant in L'aquila. They combine the flavours of Italy with Asia. Imagine a tiramisu with layers of caramelized *Nori* instead of the traditional *Savoiardi*. It has the saltiness, the umami and the sweetness combined into the famous Italian dessert. A total game changer!

As a note, L'aquila's restaurant scenario is limited to just traditional *tratorrias* and a few sushi places which the Italians are obsessed with(more on that in another post).
Fusion restaurant in a small city like L'Aquila, sounds pretty hard to sell. 
However, with their monthly menu changes and the use of seasonal products, FØRMA's head chef, Simone Ciuffetelli is a reformer. Simone and his wife, Roberta lived in Denmark for two years,
and works towards bringing their experiences and culture on a plate. As you might have guessed, the letter ø, comes from the Danish language. 


In this post, I'll try to list some of my favourites from my multiple visits to Førma. My first visit was in September 2020, almost three weeks after it opened its door to the public for dinner. I order their seasonal *antipasti* with cucumber and it was a delight. Fresh summery flavours from homemade yogurt as the base, with seared pieces of cucumbers, topped with deep fried wheat grains and a generous drizzle of olive oil.

I skipped the *primi*, and went straight to the *secondo*. Another spectacular vegetarian plate with seared cauliflower as its main. The base was made with hummus, and the crown had a dollop of the same hummus which held the organic sprouted quinoa in its place. As the Italians do it, another free-handed dribble of olive oil to finish the plating. The harmony of those flavourful bites in my mouth was orgasmic.
