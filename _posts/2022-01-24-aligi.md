title: "La Grotta di Aligi Osteria"
---
During the first year of my PhD, I was staying in our institute's student house, or Grand hotel, L'aquila. <a href="https://lagrottadialigi.com">La Grotta di Aligi Osteria</a> opened in 2019, under the Grand hotel. The osteria serves the typical flavours of Abruzzo region, like most other restaurants in the city. Chef Mario Caponio was born and brought up in Abruzzo and works towards putting a delectable meal on your plate. 


I was staying in the Grand hotel around that time, and due to the convenient location, I delayed my visit to this osteria. After 2-3 months, I finally climbed down to the basement for an early dinner. I was in a mood for *primo*, so I just ordered a classic *cacio e pepe*. The presentation was quite ritzy. The pasta was served on a crispy baked cheese bowl, and topped with generous amounts of freshly grinded black pepper and the baked cheese scrappings. The mouthfeel of the pasta was quite complex. It had the sharp saltiness from the cheese, the crispy baked cheese adding a nice contrast to the smooth pasta sauce and the kick from the freshly ground black pepper. It was a basic pasta dish elevated with the chef's imagination, however, it was a bit too salty for my taste.
